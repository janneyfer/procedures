<h1>Permacath placement</h1>
	<h2>Supplies</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>1 bonnet</li>

			<li>1 pair of sterile gloves</li>
			<li>1 surgical gown</li>
			<li>3 chloropreps</li>
			<li>4 sterile blue towels</li>
			<li>1 chlorhexidine (optional)</li>
			<li>1 sterile saline container</li>
			<li>1 sterile ultrasound probe cover (includes 1 sterile ultrasound gel, and 2 rubber bands)</li>
			<li>2 bottles of lidocaine without epinephrine (10cc)</li>
			<li>1 bottle of lidocaine with 1% epineprine</li>
			<li>several sterile 4x4 gauze pads, couple of sterile 2x2 gauze pads</li>
			<li>central line catheter kit</li>
			<li>permacath catheter kit</li>
			<li>sterile tegaderm</li>
			<li>one 3-0 ethyl suture</li>

			<li>2 10cc syringes</li>
		</ol>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
		<h3>Determine your cathter length</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Using a previous CXR, measure from the distal SVC to the clavicle, and from the clavicle to the chest. This sum equals the length of your entire permacath *** </li>
	</ol>
		<h3>Identify the internal jugular vein by ultrasound</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Identify the landmarks: lateral and medial sternocleidomastoid and clavicle. the IJ lies in the middle of this triangle</li>
		<li>The internal jugular vein lies lateral to the carotid</li>
		<li>On ultrasound, the IJ is easily compressible and the carotid is pulsatile</li>
		<li>Mark the IJ. Using your estimated catheter length, draw the path of the tunneled catheter to the chest and mark the exit site</li>
	</ol>
		<h3>Prepping the patient</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place mask and bonnet on patient</li>
			<li>The best position to cannulate the IJ is standing at the head of the bed. Place the patient in the trendelenberg position.</li>
			<li>Place chuck under the patient</li>
			<li>Clean the neck and chest with chlorhexidine. Clean a second time with chloroprep.</li>
			<li>Gown up and put on sterile gloves</li>
			<li>Fold the top two inches of a sterile drape towards you and carefully tuck it under the patient</li>
			<li>Clean the skin twice with chloroprep</li>
			<li>Drape the neck/chest with 4 sterile blue towels. Open up a sterile blue towel and fold to form a "W" and place above target vein covering the face. Place blue towels on the left and right of the vein, and a third towel at the bottom forming a rectangle around your marked sites</li>
			<li>Remove the adhesive and place the hole over the vein. Open up the drape to cover the patient's head and body. Cut the drape to reveal a rectangle from the IJ to the chest wall exit</li>
			<li>Tip: Cutting the extra drape in half gives you more sterile drape to cover the patient</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Preparing your equipment</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Place sterile saline in the saline container and designate one 10cc syringe for saline</li>
			<li>Draw 10cc of lidocaine with 1% epinephrine in one syringe and 10cc of lidocaine in a second syringe. Place small gauge needles on the syringes (ie 24) </li>
			<li>Draw 1.5cc of lidocaine in a 5cc syringe. Place the central line needle on the syringe</li>
			<li>Place ports on all ends of the catheters and flush all lines. </li>
			<li>Put together your dilator by removing the middle dilator and inserting it into the case</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Preparing your ultrasound</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>On the end with the upright arrow, place sterile gel in the pocket</li>
			<li>On the other end, count four folds place your hand in the hole with picture of the hand. Make a pocket with the gel</li>
			<li>The nurse will place the ultrasound probe inside the pocket. Grab the probe and push the ultrasound cover end towards the nurse</li>
			<li>Hold the long ultrasound cord and clamp onto the sterile blue drape</li>
			<li>Place sterile gel next to your target vein</li>
		</ol>
		<h3>Permacath placement</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Using ultrasound confirm IJ location</li>
			<li>Inject lidocaine SQ above the target vein along the path to the exit site.</li>
			<li>Repeat again with lidocaine with epinephrine, injecting along the same path as above</li>
			<li>Make a 2cm incision perpendicular to the length of the vein</li>
			<li>With the left hand hold the ultrasound with the index and thumb while anchoring the base of the probe with the remaining three fingers. Identify the IJ within the incision site</li>
			<li>With the right hand hold the central line needle like a pencil with the index finger and thumb. Use the remaining three fingers to anchor yourself</li>
			<li>Holding the needle at a steep angle (90 degrees to the skin), slowly advance the needle, bouncing to visualize the tip of the needle as it enters the IJ</li>
			<li>Watch the needle puncture the anterior wall of the vein. Bounce the needle to look for partial/incomplete cannulation of the vein. Do not cannulate the posterior wall.</li>
			<li>Drop the ultrasound and using the left hand, draw back on the syringe. Return of blood is a sign of cannulation</li>
			<li>Lower the angle of the needle. Holding the needle in place with the left hand, twist the syringe off with the right hand</li>
			<li>Watch for low flow dark venous blood return from the needle.</li>
			<li>Thread the wire to 20cm. Watch the monitor to check for PVCs. Use fluoroscopy to confirm placement</li>
			<li>Carefully remove the needle</li>
			<li>Place the dilator through the wire. Twist and advance the dilator slowly feeling for two "pops". The first pop is while going through the skin, and the second pop is while going through the vessel. After each pop, check the wire by pulling it 5mm in and out.</li>
			<li>Remove the dilator and insert the the larger dilator (the one you put together). Again, feel for the pops and check the wire
			<li>Resheath the wire</li>
			<li>In one movement, unscrew the middle catheter leaving the outer sheath and insert the catheter</li>
			<li>Twist the outer catheter (pulling up on one side, and down on the other side) and peel off. Clamp the end of the catheter</li>
			<li>Make a 3mm incision at the exit site of the catheter</li>
			<li>Using the tunneler, enter at the 3mm incision and push the tunneler subcutaneously towards the first incision site. Attach the catheter end to the end of the tunneler and pull the catheter through the tunneled path, and out at the 3mm exit site turning 360 degrees as you pull.</li>
			<li>Cut the catheter and insert the free end of the catheter connector.Attach the catheter to the end with the ports and snap into position.</li>
			<li>Flush all ports with saline. Fill a syringe with 5cc of saline and attach to port. Holding the syringe at 90 degrees draw back to check for venous blood, then push to flush the port. Be careful not to push air into the ports </li>
			<li>Using 3-0 ethyl suture, place two sutures to hold the catheter in place. Be careful not to suture too tightly
			<li> Fold a 2x2 gauze pad in half and place on catheter. Dress with tegaderm. </li> </li>
			<li>Suture the 2cm incision at the IJ with subcuticular sutures. Apply dermabond over the incision. Apply a 2x2 gauze pad folded into three and dress with tegaderm</li>

	<h2>Post-procedure</h2>
		<p>Order CXR to evaluate line placement, and rule out pneumothorax</p>
