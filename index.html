	<h1>UCLA Med-Peds Procedures</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Med-Peds procedures website! Each year our residents rotate through a very popular procedure elective at CSMC. The skills and lessons from this rotation will be outlined in this website as a source of reference for future procedures. </p>
	<p>Before each procedure review the following: </p>
	<ol>
	 	<li>General contraindications to central line placements include infection of area overlying target vein, and thrombosis of vein. Relative contraindications include coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia. </li> 
	 	<li> Complications include pneumothorax, hemothorax, infection, thrombosis, arterial puncture, and malposition. </li>
	 	<li>Previous relevant imaging. Review past CXR's for abnormal anatomy, to determine catheter length by measuring from skin to distal SVC/proximal right atrium, and determine if the patient will tolerate trendelenberg position from volume overload.  Review previous lines placement procedures looking for a history of vein complications.</li>
	 	<li>Medical history of pacemakers and devices. If the pacemaker is on the left, place the IJ line in the opposite side</li>
	 	<li>Keep in mind that the lung cupola is higher on the left and therefore a left IJ line has a slightly higher risk of pneumothorax. A left IJ will need to be placed slightly higher and the catheter will need to be longer in order to reach the right SVC.</li>
	</ol>
