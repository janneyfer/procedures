	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the Med-Peds procedures website! Every year our residents rotate through a very popular procedure elective. The skills and lessons from this rotation will be outlined in this website as a source of reference for future procedures. </p>
	<p>Before each procedure review the following: </p>
	<ol>
	 	<li>Contraindications. Common contraindications to central and peripheral line placements include coagulopathy, and thrombocytopenia.</li> 
	 	<li>Previous relevant imaging. Review past CXR's and lines.</li>
	 	<li>Medical history of pacemakers and devices. If the pacemaker is on the left, place the IJ line in the opposite side</li>
	 	<li>Keep in mind that the lung is higher on the left. A left IJ will need to be placed slightly higher and the catheter will need to be longer.</li>
	</ol>
